#### Research on how the NoSQL database works.

Before starting the project I prefer to understand how actually NoSQL works. I want to do research on the basic working of NoSQL databases. Want to understand their advantages and disadvantages. 

There are 4 differnt types of NOSQL database:
1. Key Value Store
2. Document Database
3. Column Family Stores
4. Graph Database.
