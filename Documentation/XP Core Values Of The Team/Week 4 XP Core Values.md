**COMMUNICATION:** Team members are communicating with each other what approach they are following.
                We had team meeting. The blockers which the team members had in the meeting were discussed and we 
               tried to help each other. Some of the issues which we were not able to resolve, we documented that and try to find the 
               solution for that.

  **Respect:** Utmost respect was maintained through out the meetings. Any and all criticism was positive and there was no disrespect towards
  each other. Everybodyâ€™s thoughts and ideas were taken into account and no member was made to feel left out. We also maintained respect by
  making sure that there was clear communication and also by ensuring that other core values were maintained.
