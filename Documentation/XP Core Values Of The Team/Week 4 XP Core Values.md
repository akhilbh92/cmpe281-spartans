**COMMUNICATION:** Team members are communicating with each other what approach they are following.
                We had team meeting 2 times. The blockers which the team members had in the meeting were discussed and we 
               tried to help each other. Some of the issues which we were not able to resolve, we documented that and try to find the 
               solution for that.
