**Feedback:** This week we are facing issue with microservices application development. Everyone is new with API development. So, we are helping each other. The constructive feedback followed by our team in the earlier weeks,created an environment where individuals are feeling comfortable to discuss the issues being faced.

**Communication:** This week in the meeting we distributed the task and assigned everyone their task. So now everyone is writing the code for the task they are assigned. After every 2 days we are just having a small meeting in which we discuss the issues the other person have and try toresolve it. So there is a proper communication between the team members to make sure no one is stuck at one point.
