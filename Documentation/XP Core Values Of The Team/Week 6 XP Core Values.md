**Simplicity:** During last meeting, when we were discussing the database structure, team members kept the structure as simple as possible. If anything is complicated in structure, we brainstormed the possible solution to keep it simple.

**Respect:** Proper respect was maintained among the various team members, every member was valued and all their inputs were taken into consideration without any ridicule. Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm and keeping up the morale. We understand and respect our individual weaknesses and help each other in getting better.
