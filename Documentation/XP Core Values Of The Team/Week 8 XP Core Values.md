**Communication:** As this was the last week to complete and wrap our work. We meet daily and used to work in group. Somehow we used 
                   to find time for 3 to 4 hours everyday and sit in groups to help each other.

**RESPECT:** Nobody on the team was made to feel unappreciated or ignored, every opinion and idea was respected and valued. Team members listened to each others views and opinions without passing ridicule. Team members strove to ensure that project will be of highest quality and to ensure that no delays would take place. Respect was also ensured by properly adopting the other four XP values.
