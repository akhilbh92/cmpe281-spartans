**SIMPLICITY:** Simplicity policy encourages us to start with the simplest solution first. After that you add extra functionality. 
1. We will try to keep everything simple.
2. We will try implement first, whatever we already know.
3. We will be doing what is asked for and no more than that.
4. We will divide our task in small simple steps and will try solving any failure if happens.

**COMMUNICATION:** Team members are very communicative right from day one of the Team formation. We have created social media group to communicate within the team on regular basis. Also, decided to meet personally twice in a week to discuss progress of the Project. In team meetings everyone is involving in brainstorming on the project ideas and challenges we are facing. --SAI TEJA DESU

**FEEDBACK:** Taking feedback from every individual is very crucial in progress of the project. As per my observation our project members have that quality of open mindedness in taking and giving feedback. Everyone is making sure to understand feedback properly by having extended discussions with the team.

**RESPECT:**Nobody on the team was made to feel unappreciated or ignored, every opinion and idea was respected and valued. Team members listened to each others views and opinions without passing ridicule. Team members strove to ensure that project will be of highest quality  and to ensure that no delays would take place. Respect was also ensured by properly adopting the other four XP values.

**COURAGE:** Working together as a team is giving us the courage to explore bigger possibilities regarding our project requirements. Although all team members are trying their best to solve problems on their own, having a supportive team that will help him is really reassuring. That way we have more resources at our disposal to tackle complex problems.
