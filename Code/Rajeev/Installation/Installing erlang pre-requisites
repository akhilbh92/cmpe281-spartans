Debian/Ubuntu Prerequisites
Dependencies

To install the required dependencies run the following apt-get commands:
Shell

"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libncurses5-dev openssl libssl-dev fop xsltproc unixodbc-dev git"

GUI Dependencies

If you’re using a graphical environment and want to use Erlang’s GUI utilities, you will need to install additional dependencies.

    Note on build output

    These packages are not required for operation of a Riak node. Notes in the build output about missing support for wxWidgets can be safely ignored when installing Riak in a typical non-graphical server environment.

To install packages for graphics support use the following apt-get command:
Shell

"sudo apt-get install libwxbase2.8 libwxgtk2.8-dev libqt4-opengl-dev"
